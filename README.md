### Instructions for running the code (Mac)
1. Clone this GitHub repo.
2. In the terminal, move into the `scrub` directory.
3. Make the `scrub.rb` file executable by running the following command: `chmod +x scrub.rb`.
4. Run the file followed by two command line arguments — a `sensitive_fields.txt` file and an `input.json` file, eg. `./scrub.rb sensitive_fields.txt input.json`.
5. To view the output of the code in the terminal, uncomment the ‘puts’ code on line 15.
6. To run a test comparing the output of the code to the expected output, uncomment the ‘test_code’ code on line 21 and pass in an `output.json` file as a third command line argument, eg. `./scrub.rb sensitive_fields.txt input.json output.json`.
